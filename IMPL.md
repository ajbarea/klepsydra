# IMPL: klepsydra fleet-module brief, resume state 2026-11-03 15:05 (EST)

PARKED 11-03 ~15:00 at Heph's request (AJ priority: makesense IAAI-27 camera-ready took the slot).
Resume with the same brief from this file, `git log`, open PRs and their comments, and the klepsydra
line under "Running now" in /mnt/c/Users/ajbar/fleet-briefing/queue.md. Readers: opus, dispatched
with the elenchus SKILL at ~/ajsoftworks/techne/.claude/worktrees/leak-audit/plugins/techne/skills/elenchus/
(has ledger.py); at most two at a time; each brief carries the guarded-rm and heavy-lock rules.

## Done (session 21, Chronos, Personal)
- ✅ Dependabot #268 merged (notify/tokio patch, lockfile only).
- ✅ #296 (watcher race, Fixes #297): r1 + r2 Should-fix (alert marked read before delivered; recurrence)
  fixed structurally in 0a10fe1: marking read is the watcher's last act before exit. r3 CLEAN.
- ✅ #291 r3 (unmirrored-parallel-guard, 3rd round): structural fix de9671c (make test-launch; docs
  name make targets only; the doc guard sweeps every tracked *.md). Section 32/32; red on main's AGENTS.md.
- ✅ #230 r1 fixes pushed a7ea3c5: hook suite 573/573, all five mutants fail their tests.
- ✅ RIT draft to Reznik (IAAI-27 accept) left in AJ's drafts.

## Next, in order
1. #296 fix/watch-alert-race (watch-race), head 0a10fe1, review-clean r3. CI run 41702648814 was still in
   its Fleet engine step at park. If green: merge (squash), `make install-fleet` from main, then tell
   Heph the watcher fix is live. If red: read the log; a red outside test_ci_watch.py is not this PR.
2. #230 fix/ask-217 (ask-217), head a7ea3c5: r1 fixes pushed (turns_at stamped in ask_answered; a busy
   lock makes ask_answered fail so the watcher retries; tests for the question filter, debounce, per-ask
   reset and SubagentStop with no agent_id; stub tmux serves $work/screens in turn; per-run session id).
   Next: PR body (515 -> 573; the "each guard fails its test" line is now true), then r2 reader.
   Minor left: answer before the watcher's first look (PLAUSIBLE), one lock file per session.
3. #291 fix/tasks-max-289 (tasks-289), head de9671c: r4 reader was STOPPED by the park, re-dispatch
   (brief: verify r3's two Should-fix; the briefs section runs alone as lines 1..91 + 617..731 + last 2).
   CI on de9671c was starting at park.
4. #261 fix/doctor-truth-246 (doctor-246), head 5a68e40: merge main after #296, then r10. Its CI
   41697027451 is the one to read (no rerun was made; Heph 11-03). Deferred #294.
5. #287 feat/orch-guard-264 (guard-264), head 3c5822e: PAUSED after r9 by the elenchus pause rule (r8
   and r9 each found bugs the previous fix made). Needs Heph's go-ahead for the approach change:
   date the stop by cache warmth = last main-chain assistant entry without isApiErrorMessage and
   model != <synthetic>; take the earliest of that, the screen's done time, and the first limit
   after it; no good reply = unknown refusal. Repro /tmp/claude-1001/r9/probe.sh (ok at HEAD,
   cold-limit at 5fd44a8). Minors: pin the format oracle to 30 ran on tmux 3.4; grep prefilter before
   tac|jq on huge transcripts; body count 214 -> 218. Deploy after merge: install, PreToolUse in
   ~/.claude/settings.json, `fleet accounts sync`.
6. #292 fix/tmux-dead-pane-290 (tmux-290), head 427822d: r3. needs-you has AJ's .wslconfig line.
7. #293 feat/resume-now-271 (resume-271) and #295 feat/agora-270 (agora-270): r1 each.
8. #288 fix/watch-dead-288 (dead-288), stacked on #261: rebase after #261 merges; combine with #296's
   watch-panes.sh change.
9. #272 (resume-method experiment, design first).

## Notes
- Rule (#289, 11-03): tmux-spawning tests and multi-file shellcheck run under the heavy lock, timeout inside it.
- Never nest a heredoc inside a python <<'EOF' edit: write the edit script with Write and run it.
- `gh pr edit` fails (Projects classic): `gh api -X PATCH repos/ajbarea/klepsydra/pulls/N -F body=@file`;
  phylax wants the body file written in its own call before the PATCH.
- shellcheck under WSL: `uvx --from shellcheck-py shellcheck -x <file>`; ruff: `uvx ruff@0.17.3`.
- App crate needs GTK headers WSL lacks: test `-p klepsydra-fleet` with CARGO_TARGET_DIR=.claude/worktrees/split-182/src-tauri/target.
